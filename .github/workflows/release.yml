            ## Swarm-Tools Rust v1.0.0

            Multi-platform release with all performance optimizations.

            ### Features
            - **Role-Aware Routing**: Filter context per agent role (40-65% comms savings)
            - **Codified Reasoning**: Structured JSON planning (15-25% token reduction)
            - **Trajectory Compression**: Selective compression (25-40% reduction)
            - **Self-Resource Allocation**: Contribution-based budget (10-20% savings)

            ### Combined Expected: 60-80% token reduction

            Based on research from:
            - RCR-Router (Aug 2025)
            - Trajectory Reduction (Sep 2025)
            - CodeAgents (Jul 2025)
            - BAMAS (Nov 2025)
